# Node + Express + MySQL

This is my first foray into using Node. Warning, here be amateur-ish-ness.

Just thought I'd share this as there really doesn't seem to be too many resources on the Web on how to integrate Node with MySQL. I would've looked into using the typical go-to MongoDB, but unfortunately I had the self-imposed requirement of having to add MySQL into the mix. Apologies in advance to elite Node devs.

The files in this repo were originally created by the Yeoman [generator-express](https://github.com/petecoop/generator-express) generator.

## Installation

Make sure you've got Node installed, then simply run `npm install` to install. When working on the project run `gulp`.
